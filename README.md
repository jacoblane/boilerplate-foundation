# Grunt Foundation Starter

This is a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) - [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) starter template that helps you quickly kickstart development using `grunt` in the command-line. This uses bower to install *Foundation*, *Modernizr*, *jQuery* and all the Foundation dependencies.


## Requirements

 You will need `npm`, `bower` and `grunt` installed. Search in [Google](http://google.com) for tips on how to install these command-line tools for your OS.


## Installation

After cloning this repository using the command below:

`$ git clone git@github.com:CreativityKills/foundation-grunt-starter.git`

You should `cd` to the directory where you cloned the repository into, you can run this command in the terminal:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ grunt

This should install the required `node_modules`, download the required dependencies,  compile the assets, and afterwards, start watching for changes.


## Usage

You can start developing immediately. The `dist/assets` directory contains your compiled assets. You can add your HTML documents to the `dist` directory, or however you wish. Your "raw" uncompiled asset files are stored in the `develop` folder.
